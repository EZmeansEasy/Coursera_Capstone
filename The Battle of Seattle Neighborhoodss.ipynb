Unfortunately, the plan is cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak\u2026 But if they were to come here in Seattle to attend my college graduation, where would be the best location for them to stay? The most ideal location should be close to local attractions, nearby restaurants, public transportation, and more importantly, it can\u2019t be too far from my school! In this project, I will be using what we learned in this course to try to find this ideal location. "
